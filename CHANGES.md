## 3.0.0 (2021-05-15)

- Use new Mirage signatures (#66 from @talex5)
- Better dune lower bound from @mseri (#65)
- Use new Cstruct.length (#67 from @djs55)

## 2.0.0 (2020-11-10)

- Major API change: everything is now nested inside `Hvsock`, `Hvsock_lwt`
  and `Hvsock_lwt_unix` to minimise namespace pollution.
- Add support for macOS via `hyperkit` as used in Docker for Mac
- Add support for Linux via `AF_VSOCK`
- Add test suite
- Build with dune (was jbuilder)
- Example program `hvcat` works on Mac, Windows and Linux
- Require base64 >= 3.0.0

## 1.0.3 (2018-09-10)

- Fix accept()
- Fix warnings with jbuilder --dev

## 1.0.2 (2018-06-14)

- Remove unnecessary dependency on `Bos`
- Require lwt 3.2.0 and later following the removal of lwt.preemptive

## 1.0.1 (2017-09-15)

- Move the Unix-independent module `Lwt_hvsock_main_thread` to `hvsock.lwt`
  rather than `hvsock.lwt-unix`. Note there is a dependency from `hvsock.lwt-unix`
  to `hvsock.lwt` so no user code needs to be adjusted.

## 1.0.0 (2017-07-04)

- Port to Jbuilder
- Minimum OCaml version is now 4.03.0

## 0.14.0 (2017-04-24)

- Update to MirageOS 3 (#51, @samoht)

## 0.13.0 (2017-01-20):
- use scatter-gather I/O to minimise system calls
- spawn a pair of blocking read/write threads, using a fixed amount
  of buffer
- switch to Lwt_preemptive.detach: 2x faster than Lwt_stream + run_in_main
- attempt to minimise the number of calls of Lwt_preemptive.detach

## 0.12.0 (2017-01-11):
- use a blocking connect by default, rather than a 300ms delay
- drop the OCaml heap lock in the non-blocking connect
- run the connect function in a background thread
- add appveyor and status badges

## 0.11.1 (2016-11-23):
- make connection fail within 300ms rather than 30ms to work better
  on virtualised systems

## 0.11.0 (2016-11-14):
- make connection fail within 30ms rather than 1s
- increase test coverage with more distros

## 0.10.0 (2016-07-25):
- major bug fixes in the Flow_lwt_hvsock_shutdown module
- extra robustness in case of unexpected errors from the Win32 API

## 0.9.0 (2016-07-14):
- Fix the signatures of the hvsock C stubs to include `unit` arg.

## 0.8.1 (2016-07-11)
- Fix build on OCaml 4.03
- Add an hvsock.lwt-unix subpackage for users of Lwt_unix

## 0.8 (2016-06-30)
- Increase flow buffer size to 4KiB from 1KiB
- Use Cstruct.t internally rather than marshalling to/from Byte.t
- Functorise to make compatible with Uwt as well as Lwt_unix

## 0.7 (2016-06-13)
- Treat unexpected `read` or `write` errors as `Eof in `FLOW`
- Treat unexpected `shutdown_read` and `shutdown_write` errors as `Eof`
- Clarify/add/update copyright headers in source files

## 0.6 (2016-05-25)
- Add a simple protocol with shutdown read, write and close

## 0.5 (2016-05-21)
- Bump Linux AF_HYPERV to 43
- Use one RX and one TX thread per connection
- Acquire the runtime lock before calling `uerror`

## 0.4 (2016-05-12)
- Add an implementation of V1_LWT.FLOW

## 0.3 (2016-05-12)
- Avoid running out of Lwt_preemptive thread pool threads

## 0.2 (2016-05-12)
- Work around connect() blocking forever

## 0.1 (2016-05-12)
- Initial release
